You cannot import the project directly but it's not to hard to achieve it:

Create a new Android empty project in eclipse
Overwrite the fresh res/ folder and the AndroidManifest.xml file, with the ones from the Android Studio project
Copy the content of the java/ folder from the Android Studio project (it should contain your package name folder structure, like com/example/app/, and the java files of course) in the Eclipse src folder
Link your needed libraries if it's the case
Basically the Android application fundamental elements are the java files, the manifest file and the resources. From there you can build back a project in your favorite IDE
